# Android HAL for Random Joke

This is a minimal example of an Android Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) in C++ that exposes a random joke via an AIDL interface.

## Files
- `IJokeHal.aidl`: AIDL interface definition.
- `joke_hal.cpp` / `joke_hal.h`: C++ implementation of the HAL.
- `service_main.cpp`: Example service exposing the HAL via Binder.
- `client_example.cpp`: Example client using the AIDL interface.

## Usage
This is a minimal HAL example for educational/testing purposes. Integrating a HAL into a real Android system requires additional build and integration steps.

### How it works
- The C++ class `JokeHal` provides a random joke string.
- The AIDL interface `IJokeHal` defines a method to get a random joke.
- The service (`service_main.cpp`) exposes the HAL via Binder.
- The client (`client_example.cpp`) connects to the service and prints a joke.

### Note
This is a simplified example. In a real Android system, you would need to:
- Integrate with the Android build system (Android.bp/Android.mk).
- Use the correct AIDL and Binder plumbing.
- Register the service properly.
- Handle permissions and security.
